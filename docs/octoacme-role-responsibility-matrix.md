# OctoAcme — Role & Responsibility Matrix Template

A lightweight RACI-style template to clarify who is **Responsible**, **Accountable**, **Consulted**, and **Informed** for key activities in a project. Fill this in at kickoff and update as the team evolves.

> **Legend:** R = Responsible (does the work) · A = Accountable (owns the outcome) · C = Consulted (input needed) · I = Informed (kept in the loop)

## How to Use

1. Copy this table into your project doc or project board.
2. Add or remove rows for activities specific to your project.
3. Fill in roles from [OctoAcme Roles & Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) that apply.
4. Leave cells blank if a role is not involved in that activity.
